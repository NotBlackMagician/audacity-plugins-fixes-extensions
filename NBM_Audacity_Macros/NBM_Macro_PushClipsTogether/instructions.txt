HOW TO INSTALL:
In order to import the Macro, inside Audacity go to:
Tools -> Macro Manager
Click on "Import" and choose the .txt file with Macro inside it


HOW TO USE:
Move your whole project with all the clips to the beginning (Use Ctrl + A for that)
Find the first break between the clips and set your cursor in there.
Use Macro from:
Tools -> Apply Macro -> (name of the Macro)
Everything should be closer to the first clip now

AUTOMATION:
You can set the shortcut for any Macro, simply by searching for it by its name in "Keyboard Shortcuts" panel
In order to quickly close the gaps between the clips the best approach is:
Set shortcuts for:
1. Your chosen Macro (eg. Ctrl + Alt + U)
2. Cursor to Next Clip Boundary (eg. Ctrl + Alt + RightArrow)
Then you start by clicking in the first gap in your project
Ctrl + Alt + U
Ctrl + Alt + RightArrow - Use it as many times as you need to go over next gap
RightArrow - it doesn't move anything, it just removes any selection
LeftArrow - it moves the cursor to the gap on the left from our clip


Start the whole procedure once again
